        <h3>Tell me something about you!</h3>
        <p>I am currently a graduate student in <a href="https://www.iit.edu/"> Illinois Institute of Technology</a>.
        Prior to that I have 10 years of working experience.
        I am an Indian and my native home is in the eastern part of India.
        I know three different languages--Bengali, Hindi and English.
        My areas of interest are literature, politics, Information Technology
        and Astrology. Currently, I am writing a book based on the life of <a href="https://www.arjunmajumdar.co.in/">
