        Summer vacation always reminds me a picturesque village near the river Subarnarekha where
        I spent most of my childhood summer vacations.
        My Buaa (father’s sister) used to live in a village called Bakhrabad somewhere in the post-colonial rural India.
        Her small, leaf thatched, and mud-made cottage has always been a major fascination to me.
        The cottage was not enough to accommodate two of us, but still it seemed to me the largest corner of the universe.
        This was when the electronic appliances did not pave its way to our daily life.
        I used to sleep in the outside cottage extension, not to avoid heat,
        but to face the canopy of stars in visibly dark night.
        The sparkling lights of these tiny particles travel millions and millions way to reach us to which most of the human
        beings have no meaning.
        But stars play a vital role in shaping humans from the aboriginal savage life to the magnificent technologically
        advanced life.
        When our forefathers looked up in the sky they found geometry, science, mathematics and probably everything that
        makes us human what we are today.
        These glittering particles tells me about my forefathers and their principles.
        Everyday I had a fixed appointment with the stars.
        In my childhood I could never understand the reason behind this unconditional attachment towards the stars which
        I discovered in my later life.
        I would unfold this to my readers in a fashionable manner.
        The night I am talking about here was special though it may look ordinary. My Buaa was a very good cook.
        I relished the dinner and went on to sleep on my bed or the ‘launching pad’ from where
        I made a giant leap to the universe.
        The journey of my universe end with an infiltrated oracle, “Tinku, wake up, I have good news for you!”
        I woke up smudging the traces of the last night’s ‘universal journey’ from my eyes.
        I found the captain of your local football team was standing in front of me with an energetic and smiling appearance.
        Reader may think what role a football team captain plays in between phenomenon like ‘universe’ and ‘star’?
        Apparently, there is no direct connection between them.
        But I would appreciate if readers, for a while, consider football as a game of physics.
        A well-prepared ground with two goal-posts at the opposite edges of the ground,
        a ball with the universal ratio of 22:7 and the players are not the only component of this game.
        A good understanding of speed, force and space is also required to master this game.
        Football has no connection with stars, but it has connection the universal laws.
        Let’s see what my captain has to offer to me.
        I asked eagerly, “what is the good news all about?” He replied, “you have been selected in our football team.”
        The moment it entered my ears, I felt an enormous pleasure and relief to my soul.
        I was working out very hard to get a position in the football team. I always lured an eternal love for football,
        but I never had a chance to show my skills in an audience packed ground.
        This news gave me an golden opportunity to fulfill my wish. The next day our preparation for the match was started.
        Me and some more young footballers gathered in the football ground.
        The captain briefed us about the match that our opponent is very strong tactically and physically.
        He also cautioned us that if we do not win the match it would throw us out of the tournament.
        My blood veins were fully electrified, and I was at the pinnacle of confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, the most awaited day arrived in my life, the day of the match.
        I woke up early in the morning and did all the morning activities.
        The sky was neat and clean, there was no sign of any atrocities.
        We reached the football ground at 11.00 AM though our match was scheduled for 4 PM.
        Many football teams gathered in the Bakhrabad football ground for the tournament and
        more than 500 spectators had come to enjoy the tournament.
        I was overwhelmed to see such an ambience. My hormones were flowing like a stream of current.
        But all my curiosity and expectation fall to an end when
        I came to know that my name was not in the list of regular players,
        it was in the list of replacement players.
        My happiness was fragmented into installments.
        I understood that my primary role in the tournament would not be as player but as a spectator.
        I was roaming around the ground and meeting different players of different teams.
        Suddenly, a bunch of tall guys attracted my attention.
        They were the players of Belda football team who was our opponent.
        I recalled my captain’s word and found those words ere exactly same as I can see.
        The players were not only tall and strong but also highly motivated which was evident in their body language.
        Meanwhile, the match started at the scheduled time.
        At the beginning of the game, Belda team started dominating, our team was chasing well though.
        But only ‘chasing’ does not guarantee the win. I feared that their dominating attitude may crush our dreams.
        The spectators of the ground were roaring and shouting like a lion.
        The match was enjoyable. Their forward players were continuously swapping their positions,
        as a part of their strategy to confuse our defense players.
        As a result, they scored a goal within 90 seconds of the game before half-time.
        This added an extra layer of madness among their supporters. They started roaring with doubled energy and force.
        I was praying if I could give them a befitting reply
        </p>
        <p>
          I reckoned that our players were losing hope and confidence in the ground.
          Our players were fighting like soldiers in the ground, but nothing was helping them.
          Belda team supporters were shouting in front of our players as to destabilize the mentality of the player.
          Nothing could be done before the end of the first half.
          I went to the dressing room where our players gathered to make strategy against Belda team.
          On the other hand, Belda team dressing room was shouting in chorus as if they had already won the match.
          I was praying to the God if I could diminish their over-confidence and arrogance.
          Our captain boosts the confidence of our players to strike with more power,
          “Dear team, it is a do or die situation for us, don’t lose your faith and hope on the
          Almighty, he is always on our side, he always helps one who helps themselves.”
          Our captain was a good motivational speaker under whose leadership our team recapitulated the desire of winning.
          The second half of the game was interesting. We could score one goal and become equal to them.
          This restored my hope and faith.
          This was the first time when Belda team realized that ‘never underestimate the opponent’ theory.
          Belda players had lost coordination due to over-confidence and that’s why they paid the cost of one goal.
          But they regain their force and become more aggressive to hit back to our team.
          Our defense players too defused their every smart move.
          As the match going towards the end it gradually became a war between two teams.
          Their constant attack on our defense was giving a tough situation.
          Just nine minutes before the end of the match, a mishap happened.
          One of our center-forward players got seriously injured and carried off on a stretcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          My captain summoned me as a replacement. My blood was boiling inside of me to win this match.
          When I stepped in the ground, I felt the cold stream of Subarnarekha was flowing through my veins.
          It gave an eternal pleasure and calmed down my mental situation.
          The tremendous noise of the field was kept in the background.
          I could not see any other thing except the goal-post and the round object on the ground.
          I became, for that time being, the reincarnation of mythological character of Mahabharat, Arjun.
          Once Dronacharya organized a competition of piercing a fish eye among the Pandavs.
          He set one wooden fish in front of the Pandavs and gave them an arrow to pierce the eye of the fish.
          He asked Arjun what he could see. Arjun replied that he could only see the eye of the fish,
          while other Pandavs were focused on the leaves and the branches of the tree on which the wooden bird was kept.
          My situation was like Arjun. I could not see anything except the goal-post. Only one thing was in my mind, victory.
          My entire body was shivering in excitement, my feet was vibrating like an electrified element.
          I lost control over my body, my feet and my mind. I had no clue that a miraculous phenomenon was awaiting.
          The football made a swift move against the opposite goal-post on its own.
          An unknown force pushed me through, and I started running towards the oppositions’ region.
          I was running like a current just behind the football.
          I was not even touching the football, but it made its own way throughout the opponent players.
          It seemed that the football was full of consciousness like a human being.
          The consciousness of winning connected me and the football in the same string.
          We both became a part of one entity.
          When we ran through the ground and came closer to the goal-post, the goalkeeper was stunned.
          I did not know when I kicked the ball and it went into the goal-post.
          I saw the ball was floating on the air and went inside the goal-post.
          I got my senses back on hearing a thundering sound of final whistle and people’s scream “goal! goal!”.
          My fellow teammates came running behind me and threw me in the air. All this happened ultra-quickly.
          I heard some people were saying, “the ball must have been under the guidance of ghosts,
          otherwise it is nearly impossible to score a goal like this.” Later, I picked up the ball on my hand.
          The football was completely lifeless, but I could see a smile on its face which no one else could see.
